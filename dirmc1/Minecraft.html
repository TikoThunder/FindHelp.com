                Darthon is a community server with the purpose of having fun and helping people bond. The very first version of darthon was a small towny server where we had a nice community and almost reached an average of 5 players at all times
                of the day. Unfortunately the demise of the game soon came after <i>JulesBeHere</i> didn't have the resources to oversee the sever, so the server shut down. This Feburary of 2022 the server was relaunched as a semi vanilla
                server with an economy. Darthon will be up and running for the foreseeable future.
